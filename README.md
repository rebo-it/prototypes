Repository for prototyiping the main [web](https://github.com/rebo-it/web/)
page (and repository) that the principal project will have.

## Usage (`npm`)

`npm` is a package manager that let's you install, change and/or remove
dependencies (packages) as well as run some scripts that can let you build,
run or test the project.

Below, the information that is provided by default, and the one we will be
using for this project.

> In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

> Runs the app in the development mode.\
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
> 
> The page will reload if you make edits.\
> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

> Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
> See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

> Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
